# Mental-Health-Survey-Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a mental health survey dataset (sourced from Kaggle) to understand how factors such as occupation, gender, family history, workplace environment, and awareness of care options influence stress levels and treatment-seeking behavior.
The analysis explores patterns across demographics and occupations, evaluates the role of work-related factors, and identifies barriers to openly discussing mental health.
The project is structured around 11 guiding questions (Q1–Q11), each supported with visualizations and insights.

### 📈 **Tools & Libraries Used**
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and storytelling
Visualization: Bar plots, heatmaps, and comparative charts

### 🔎 **Key Analysis Questions (Q1–Q11)**
Q1: Which occupations report more mental health issues?

Q2: Is family history a factor influencing mental health?

Q3: Which gender reports higher struggles, and what factors affect them most?

Q4: Do work-related factors affect people’s mental health?

Q5: Are people who received treatment in better condition compared to those who did not?

Q6: Which countries report the highest number of mental health issues (male vs. female)?

Q7: Are there noticeable patterns across months and years?

Q8: Which occupations show increasing stress levels across countries?

Q9: Does spending time indoors affect stress, mood swings, social interaction, and habits?

Q10: What do responses reveal about willingness to participate in mental health interviews?

Q11: Which occupational groups are more aware of care options?

### 💡 **Key Insights**
- Housemakers, students, and corporate employees report higher mental health issues compared to other groups.
- Family history is not strongly linked to the overall prevalence in this dataset.
- Male respondents dominate the dataset, though gender ratios are mostly consistent across occupations except in corporate roles.
- Work interest and social interaction significantly reduce stress, while lack of engagement increases it.
- Even after treatment, many respondents still experience growing stress.
- US, UK, and Canada report the highest number of cases, likely reflecting awareness and reporting culture.
- Many respondents are unwilling to discuss mental health in interviews, highlighting persistent stigma.
- Awareness of care options varies across occupations, with homemakers, students, and corporate employees showing relatively higher awareness.

### 🏁 **Conclusion**
The findings show that mental health is deeply affected by work-related stress, lifestyle, and awareness of support options.
While awareness is improving, stigma, uneven communication of resources, and limited treatment effectiveness remain key barriers.

### 📌 **Recommendation**
Organizations should promote mental health awareness, ensure resources are communicated effectively, and create a culture where employees feel safe discussing mental health challenges.
